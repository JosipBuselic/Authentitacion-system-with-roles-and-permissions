# Authentication System with Roles and Permissions

This project is a full-stack **authentication system** built using modern technologies including **Next.js** for the frontend, **Flask** (Python) for the backend API, and **Supabase** as the database backend. It implements user authentication with role-based access control (RBAC), allowing different permissions based on user roles. Passwords are securely hashed using **Werkzeug** to protect user credentials.

## Features

- **User Registration & Login:**  
  New users can register with an email and password. Passwords are hashed using Werkzeugâ€™s secure hashing functions before storing in the database. Existing users can log in to access their accounts.

- **Role-Based Access Control:**  
  The system supports roles assigned to users:  
  - **Admin** (role ID 1): Full control except for changing user passwords. Admins can edit user emails, usernames, and roles, including promoting other users to admins.  
  - **User** (role ID 2): Regular users who can view and edit their own profiles except passwords.

- **Admin Panel:**  
  Admin users have access to an admin dashboard where they can view all registered users, edit their details (excluding passwords), and assign roles.

- **Logout Functionality:**  
  Users can securely log out, terminating their session.

- **Database:**  
  Uses **Supabase** (PostgreSQL) to store user data, roles, and permissions.

- **Password Security:**  
  Passwords are never stored in plain text. They are hashed using **Werkzeug**, which provides a secure and tested hashing mechanism.

- **Frontend:**  
  Built with **Next.js**, a React framework supporting server-side rendering and static site generation, enhancing performance and SEO.
